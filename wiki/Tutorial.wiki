The software is using the following Java libraries, provided with the package:

  * Colt library for high performance computing ([http://acs.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/license.html web]).
  * XOM library for xml parsing ([http://xom.nu web]).
  * Epsgraphics library to create figures ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsgraphics/ web]).
  * Apache CLI library to parse command line arguments ([http://commons.apache.org/cli/ web]).
  * The BiNGO Java library to calculate GO enrichment ([http://www.psb.ugent.be/cbd/papers/BiNGO/ web]).

Coding crew:
  * Tom Michoel
  * Eric Bonnet
  * Anagha Joshi
  * Steven Maere

Requirements:
  * Java version 1.6 or higher installed.

= Installation =

The LemonTree software is a command line program, there is no graphical user interface (at this stage). The package is a zipped archive that you have to unzip in the directory of your choice.

Let's take an example. Say the archive was unpacked in /home/jdoe/progs/. You can call the program by the command:

{{{
java -jar /home/jdoe/progs/lemone.jar
}}}

You can pass memory size parameters to the java virtual machine, it might help if you have a large dataset. For example, this command is allocating 10 Gigabytes of memory (max.) for the program:

{{{
java -Xmx10g -jar /home/jdoe/progs/lemone.jar 
}}}

An alternative to launch the program is to set the CLASSPATH environmental variable to include the path to the LemonTree jar file and also to all the Java libraries (located in the "lib/" directory of the package). Then you can launch the program with the command:

{{{
java lemontree.modulenetwork.RunCli
}}}

= Synopsis =

The purpose of the LemonTree software package is to create a module network from expression data. The end result is a set of gene clusters (co-expressed genes), and their associated "regulators".  To achieve this goal, you'll have to follow the LemonTree recipe, which consists of different steps that have to be performed. For each step, you'll have to use one or more specific part of the software, which are
designated as "tasks".
