= Installation =


You will need the java version 1.6 installed on your system. The current
version of LeMoNe is a command-line program. There's no graphical user
interface. All you have to do is to unzip the package in a given directory, and you're basically done.

Let's take an example. Say the archive was unpacked in /home/jdoe/progs/. You can call the program by the command:

{{{
java -jar /home/jdoe/progs/lemone.jar
}}}

You can pass memory size parameters to the java virtual machine, it might help if you have a large dataset. For example, this command is allocating 10 Gigabytes of memory (max.) for the program:

{{{
java -Xmx10g -jar /home/jdoe/progs/lemone.jar 
}}}
