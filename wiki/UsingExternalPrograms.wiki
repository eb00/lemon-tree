#summary using external programs to feed Lemon-Tree algorithm.

= Introduction =

Due to the modular nature and simple input/output format of the program, it's easy to use external tools to generate input data for Lemon-Tree algorithm using external tools. Here we describe two cases on how to proceed to feed data to the program.
