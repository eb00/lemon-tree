#summary using external programs to feed Lemon-Tree algorithm.

= Introduction =

Due to the modular nature and simple input/output format of the program, it's easy to use external tools to generate input data for Lemon-Tree algorithm using external tools. Here we describe two cases on how to proceed to feed data to the program.

== External clustering == 

Many different algorithms can be used to cluster a matrix of gene expression data. For example, the R statistical software has literally hundreds of different package to perform this procedure ([http://wiki.math.yorku.ca/index.php/R:_Cluster_analysis see a list here]).

The results of the clustering procedure can be used in Lemon-Tree as the input for
